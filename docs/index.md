# Exemplar-based Inpainting

A Python package implementing the exemplar-based image inpainting algorithm of Criminisi et al., presented in: 

> `Criminisi A, PÃ©rez P, Toyama K. Region filling and object removal by exemplar-based image inpainting[J]. IEEE Transactions on image processing, 2004, 13(9): 1200-1212.`

As opposed to other open implementations that you may find on the web, this project only relies on OpenCV and Numpy to implement the main steps of the inpainting process.
