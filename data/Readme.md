Images image<X>/mask<X>.jpg (X = [1..7]) were obtained from the [inpaint-object-remover project](https://github.com/igorcmoura/inpaint-object-remover).

While they resemble the images from the original paper, note that they aren't the "original" images/masks used by the authors for providing the results shown in the original paper by Criminisi et al.
